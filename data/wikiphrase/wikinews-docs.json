Ahenakew stated that Jews were \"a disease\" and that Hitler was trying to \"clean up the world\" when he \"fried six million of those guys.\"\n\nThe Advisory Council of the Order of Canada met on June 29 at Rideau Hall, the residence of the Governor General, to discuss Ahenakew's fate. After the meeting, Ahenakew was sent a letter, asking for him to respond to the possible revocation or surrender his membership voluntarily. A deadline for Ahenakew to respond was set at July 9, which Ahenakew did not. That led to Governor General signing the ordinance to remove Ahenakew from the Order. Ahenakew has to surrender his Order insignia, which consists of a medal, lapel pin, and scroll. Ahenakew loses the right to use post-nominal letters in his name, and loses the right to use the Order motto in his personal coat of arms.","title":"David Ahenakew removed from the Order of Canada"},{"doc_id":28,"text":"John Garang, recently sworn in as Vice President of the Sudan, was confirmed dead after his helicopter disappeared yesterday. Sudanese state television initially reported him to be alive but it now appears Mr. Garang died after his helicopter crashed.\n\nGarang became Vice President in a historic deal, which ended the southern rebellion after 20 years of fighting.

Habyarimana's assassination helped trigger Rwanda's infamous genocide, recently portrayed in the movie \"Hotel Rwanda\".\n\nGarang's party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, has appealed for calm, insisting that his death was an accident.\n\nIn a press release published on the website Allafrica.com, Uganda's President Museveni appeared to be keeping an open mind about the circumstances of the crash, which he says took place on the Ugandan-Sudanese border. \"The helicopter was a recently overhauled executive helicopter that has served us well for the last 8 Years\", he is quoted as saying, detailing a number of technical improvements recently made to the craft.

Al-Manar now can be viewed in Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East, and most of Europe, a blow to Israel who is trying to fight Hezbollah. Many fear this will increase support and recruiting for Hezbollah, which the United States, Israel and some other countries consider a terrorist organization. Thaicom considers Al-Manar programming as \"news and entertainment.\"\n\nAl-Manar was designated a 'terrorist entity', and banned by the United States in December 2004.

By 2004, Al Manar was estimated to hold 10-15 million viewers daily worldwide. Critics claim al-Manar's agenda is influenced by Iran by virtue of the \"significant portion\" of Hezbollah's budget shortfall that is covered by Iran, via some of the \"US$100 and $200 million a year\" Iran provides to Hezbollah itself. Al-Manar officials strongly deny this, saying they are subsidized by the Hezbollah party and donations from other Muslims, not by Iran. Al-Manar calls itself the \"Station of the Resistance\" and is a key player in what Hezbollah calls its \"psychological warfare against the Zionist enemy\"\n\n\"It's a war.

The ban is to be signed and ratified by each country during December 2-3 in Oslo, Norway, the country that initiated the discussions on the ban.\n\nFollowing almost two weeks of negotiations, the ban was agreed upon at a ceremony held in Dublin, Ireland. Signatories will be required to completely get rid of cluster bomb stockpiles within eight years.\n\nCluster bombs are characterized by the small \"bomblets\" that they release while falling. Many are opposed to this type of munition because the \"bomblets\" spread over a large area, meaning that they can easily injure or kill innocent civilians even when aimed at a specific enemy target.\n\nDespite U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voicing his hopes that all nations would agree to the ban, many countries have boycotted the ban, including the United States, Russia, Israel, Pakistan and India. Military analyst Marc Garlasco of the organization Human Rights Watch noted that these nations will be less likely to use the munitions due to the stigma that will be attached to them.\n\nWhile widely celebrated, some criticize the pact for not being strong enough in its implications. For example, signatories will still be allowed to cooperate on military operations with non-signatories.\n\nThe ban will go into effect in mid-2009.","title":"Ban on cluster bombs adopted by 111 countries"},{"doc_id":127,"text":"Finland, Estonia and Greece have all ratified the European Union's Treaty of Lisbon, also known as the Reform Treaty.

They plan to test it for signs of organic material and minerals, and hope to find out if the ice was ever a liquid which could have supported microbial life.\n\nIn December of 2006, scientists announced that the Mars Global Surveyor captured images of deposits in gullies on the surface of the planet Mars which have been created since the areas were photographed nine years ago.

The disaster involved a Concorde crash on July 25, 2000 near Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Paris, France that killed all 109 on board and four more on the ground. It was carrying mostly German tourists to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.\n\nThe crash occurred after a metal strip detached from a Continental DC-10 that departed before the Concorde and was left behind on the runway. When Concorde took off afterwards it hit the strip, which punctured a tyre. As the tyre disintegrated a piece of debris punctured a fuel tank, triggering a large fire as the jet took off. The badly damaged aircraft crashed into a hotel before it was able to perform an emergency landing. The final report was not released until 2004.\n\nOne Continental employee, mechanic John Taylor, is being charged over making and installing the non-standard strip. Head of maintenance Stanley Ford is being charged for allowing the part to be modified by Taylor without clearing the changes properly, and the airline is charged for allowing the widebodied passenger jet back into the air and having failed to maintain it adequately. It is also claimed the titanium strip should have been made of softer aluminium, which had a lower risk of damaging tyres.\n\nThree further individuals have been charged as well. Henri Perrier, head of the initial Concorde programme at Aerospatiale, Jacques Herubel, Concorde chief engineer at the time and Claude Frantzen, ex-head of technical services at the French civil aviation authority are all facing charges. The charges are primarily for involuntary manslaughter.\n\nAs a result of the Concorde disaster the aircraft was grounded pending emergency modifications. It was official removed from service in 2003 by its only two operators, British Airways and Air France. The model's first commercial flight was in 1976, and it was the world's first supersonic airliner.

This is according to reports by ITAR-Tass, RIA Novosti and Interfax, all of which cited an unnamed Kremlin official as saying that the US proposal did not go far enough. \"Russia is ready to cooperate with the United States on European security but considers the proposals that were sent are insufficient,\" the source said. \"We will not give our agreement to these proposals and we will speak to the new administration.\" The United States under the George W.

Kaliningrad is a Russian territory, disconnected from the rest of the country, and situated between Poland and Lithuania, which are both NATO members.\n\nBarack Obama, who is due to be sworn-in as president of the United States on January 20, 2009, made no commitments to the missile program during his campaign for office.\n\n\"Obama's position is as it was throughout the campaign: he supports deploying a missile defense system when the technology is proved to be workable,\" said Denis McDonough, a foreign-policy advisor for Obama.","title":"Russia rejects latest US proposal on missile defense"},{"doc_id":151,"text":"Chen Shui-bian Following detention stemming from corruption allegations, former Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian is reportedly on hunger strike.

The Senate version was orchestrated by Senator Baucus, a Democrat from Montana. The bill was released without any Republican support from the committee. However, today, the bill received support from a bi-partisan group of Senators including the Republican Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Independent Joe Liberman. If the bill's passage is determined along party lines, Democrats will need at least one Republican Senator to avoid a possible filibuster in the Senate.\n\nThe proposal mandates nation-wide individual insurance by 2013 and omits a government-run insurance clause as is included in the U.S. House version; instead, the plan calls for non-profit healthcare cooperatives. The healthcare cooperatives would be provided with US$6 billion in initial funding to cover start-up fees and costs. Individuals refusing to obtain coverage can be charged up to US$950 annually with families fined up to US$3,800 per year. Small businesses will not be mandated to provide healthcare to their employees but those who do will receive tax credits. Also, insurances companies that have more expensive individual plans will be taxed for 35% of the amount that that the plan exceeds the federal individual threshold of US$8,000 or the family threshold of US$21,000. The bill includes clauses for protection against coverage suspensions due to illnesses and protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions. It will not pre-empt state laws on abortion and does not provide for abortion payments except in cases of rape or incest. The plan also mandates registration with the Social Security Administration as a means to avoid illegal alien use of the program.\n\nThe bill will reportedly be paid for by US$850 billion in spending reduction, taxes and fees to include reduction in Medicare benefits. The Senate Finance Committee is the last approval authority before the Senate or House bills can be considered for floor debate.","title":"U.S. Senate releases version of Healthcare Bill"},{"doc_id":191,"text":"A spokesman for the German government has announced plans to walk out of the United Nations General Assembly if Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust in a speech he is due to give on Wednesday.\n\nThe spokesman said, \"We will leave the hall if President Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust or makes anti-Semitic statements ... we are making efforts toward a unified European position,\" going on to request a \"common response\" from other European Union member nations.

Currently held at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay, they are requesting release to the United States, contrary to a measure voted last week by the House of Representatives permitting the transfer of prisoners to the US for trial, but explicitly forbidding their release to the US. Congress passed the legislation yesterday.\n\nThe legislation requires an assessment of potential security risks, including what dangers are involved, how the threat can be diminished, legal arguments and assurances about the detainee's level of risk to the relevant state governor, to be provided 45 days prior to prosecution in the US. Under these measures, the President must provide Congress with the detainee's name, destination, a risk assessment, and transfer terms in order to release them to another country.\n\nThe Uighurs are still being detained, despite the Pentagon clearing them of all charges in 2004.

Five went to Albania in 2006 and another four went to Bermuda in June. The island of Palau has said it will take twelve, leaving just one.

It is the first time ants have been found using more than one antibiotic in combination. The new antibiotics discovered have anti-fungal effect, and can be useful for modern medicine. UK Medical Research Council funded the investigation.\n\nAcromyrmex octospinosus leaf cutter ants form the biggest known animal colonies, reaching several million individuals. They are native to South and Central America, but are now found in the southern United States as well. They are known to grow fungi gardens, and this is why the researchers looked into the interaction of ants and fungi. The scientists collected them from three colonies in Trinidad and Tobago. UEA professor Dr Matt Hutchings explained, \"This was really a fun project which started with a PhD student, Joerg Barke, streaking leaf-cutting ants onto agar plates to isolate antibiotic producing bacteria.\"\n\nThe health of a certain type of fungus gardens is vital for the ants colony since the fungus is used to feed larvae and the queen. The antibiotics act both as herbicides and regulators of fungus growth. The antibiotics are produced by actinomycete bacteria, which live in a state of symbiosis with the ants, and are found on the bodies of the ants themselves. The symbiotic relationships benefit both the ants and the bacteria.\n\nAs a result of the study, a new antibiotic has also been discovered. It's related to nystatin, one of the antifungals used in modern medicine. The researchers expect to discover more new antibiotics and are optimistic about their use in medicine. Dr Matt Hutchings who was leading the research said, \"It's also very exciting that ants not only evolved agriculture before humans but also combination therapy with natural antibiotics.

The phaseout started last year when 100W light bulbs were outlawed. Bulbs of 60W will be phased out next year, and incandescent lighting of all types will be phased out in 2012.\n\nThe phase-out of incandescent light bulbs is part of the EU's strategy to cut greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020. Replacing the old lamps with more efficient models is expected to reduce energy consumption for lighting by 60% in the EU, equivalent to saving 30 million tons of CO2 pollution every year.\n\nAlthough energy-saving bulbs were available since 1998, their relatively high purchase price has inhibited take-up. When the decision for the ban was taken in 2008, it was estimated that around 2,000 to 3,000 jobs would become redundant in the light bulb industry, in particular affecting Hungary and Poland. However, the European Commission also assumed that halogen production and savings of 5-10 billion euro from energy bills could be injected back into the economy to create new jobs.\n\nIn its editorial yesterday, the conservative The Washington Times harshly criticized the ban, labelling it a result of \"bureaucratic irritation\" and a \"war on Edison's greatest invention\". General criticism of such bans includes panic buying prior to phase-out, environmental impacts of the mercury which is contained in small amounts in all fluorescent lamps, and increased upfront costs for the consumer.\n\nBrazil and Venezuela started to phase out incandescent light bulbs in 2005, Switzerland in 2009, while Russia and Canada are planning it for 2012.

Although many European countries manufacture the drug, which is primarily used in Europe as an an\u00e6sthetic, no manufacturer has been found that is willing to supply it for use in conjunction with the death penalty, the abolition of which has been lobbied by the EU since 2008.\n\nThe shortage means that executions in California and Oklahoma have been delayed, with Texas' last remaining stocks of the drug due to expire in March, weeks before two scheduled executions. These delays are likely to be prolonged as the legal process of drawing up new drugs to be used for injections is lengthy. Pentobarbital, an alternative which used at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, is used for lethal injections in Oregon, and has started to be used by Oklahoma.\n\nHospira's decision caused mixed reactions throughout the medical community, with the American Society of Anesthesiologists stating Monday that sodium thiopental is an \"important and medically necessary anesthetic agent\" that is a \"first-line anesthetic in many cases\", citing geriatric and cardiovascular conditions, among others.

Stone explained \"we were working on a theory that could predict what could be used to form a laser,\" and the theory also predicted the possibility of an anti-laser. Lasers amplify light to produce coherent pulses. The new anti-laser focuses two identical laser beams towards each other. The light is trapped in an optical cavity and bounces until all the energy is converted into heat. The one constructed by Yale used a piece of silicon 110 micrometers wide; it absorbed 99.4% of light at a wavelength of 998.5 nanometers, which is close to infrared.\n\nStone felt \"heory and experiment matched very well. We couldn't have expected to do any better.\" The theory suggests that 99.999% could be absorbed, but Yale blamed \"experimental limitations\" for not achieving this. Yale explained that more sophisticated anti-lasers may approach this absorption rate, and added that simulations suggest much smaller versions could be made.\n\nThe research team believes it could have applications in supercomputing, with machines using light and not electrons like regular computers. Many computer components are already manufactured from silicon. Since the energy is dissipated as heat, however, use is limited against laser weapons since the heat would damage the target anyway.\n\nGeneral light-absorption is not difficult, according to Stone, but this is the first time a device has been built targeted to the specific-wavelength beams produced by lasers.","title":"Yale University builds world's first anti-laser"},{"doc_id":315,"text":"Her Excellency, Quentin Bryce, Governor-General of Australia is set to travel to Kuwait to commemorate the 20 year anniversary of the liberation of the country from Iraqi rule.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, honey-producing colonies in the U.S. have declined from 5.5 million colonies in 1950 to 2.5 million in 2007. A co-author of the report, Peter Neumann, said changes in rural areas during the past 50 years have contributed to decline of wild bees and other pollinators. Additional factors include the declines in flowering plants, the use of harmful chemicals and insecticides, the increase in air pollution and a worldwide trade system that spreads bee pathogens and pests.\n\nThe world's growing population means more bees are needed to pollinate the crops to feed more people. According to the U.N. report, of the 100 crop species that supply 90 percent of the world's food, bees pollinate more than 70 percent.

I am 61 now so I really started when I was about 10 years old even though I had seen and worked with some basic tricks a few years earlier. I remember going into Hollywood Magic and wanting that big red box with the dragons on it and I didn't even know what it did. The magician behind the counter was wise enough not to sell it to me, but instead sold me two books which I still own today &mdash; \"Scarne on Card Tricks\" and \"Scarne on Magic Tricks\". That started me out on books and I have amassed quite a few since then. My major influences on performance are Eugene Burger and Michael Skinner.\n\nOctober is National Magic Month in the US.

There will always be an audience for good magicians doing good magic.\n\nHas the internet helped or hurt magic?\n\n:WE: Both. I think it has helped draw younger people to magic as a hobby, but I think it has hurt the ability of young magicians to think because so many rely on the internet for everything and they aren't reading the books. We have to have knowledge of the history of magic and what has been done before. Moreover, seeing someone perform on the internet takes away the use of our senses, originality and imagination that reading and thinking about magic can produce. Anyone can become a monkey; it takes serious study to become a magician.\n\nDo you travel much in your current role?\n\n:WE: Yes, I am traveling quite a bit.

The spacecraft, which launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 2117 UTC on Tuesday , was originally scheduled to dock with the space station at 0304 UTC on Wednesday. It was not in the proper orientation to execute one of the engine burns required as part of the expedited rendezvous procedure used since last year, however, and docking with the ISS was delayed until yesterday. The mission reverted to the flight plan used on Soyuz flights to the ISS previously: a longer, two-day, 34-orbit rendezvous.\n\nThe precise cause of the malfunction has not yet been publicly announced, but NASA said Wednesday, all systems aboard the Soyuz appeared to be functioning normally despite the setback which prevented a docking approximately six hours after launch.

Davie, 93, was known for his colourful abstract paintings.\n\nDavie's career also saw turns as a jeweler, a jazz musician, a lecturer, and a poet. Born in Grangemouth, near Falkirk, in 1920, he studied painting from 1938 to 40 at Edinburgh College of Art. His father was a teacher who dabbled in art and his mother's family was musically inclined. Upon seeing Coleman Hawkins performing in a music shop in Edinburgh, Davie borrowed \u00a3600 from his father to buy himself a saxophone. After serving in the Second World War, at which time he wrote much poetry later transcribed by his father, Davie toured with Scottish jazz bands.\n\nDavie's work was admired by the likes of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and David Hockney. Davie himself collected non-Western art and liked tattoos, graffiti, and 'outsider art'. His final interview before death, with The Telegraph, gave an insight into how he viewed art: \"It's an urge, an intensity, a kind of sexual need something I do from an inner compulsion, that has to come out.\" Flickr He initially avoided painting as a career at all, then spent several years earning money by other means whilst his paintings failed to sell. His exhibitions in the late 1950s, however, were highly successful and launched his career. He was in the habit of choosing titles for his art only after completion.\n\nDespite a strong presence owing to his lengthy red beard and off-beat humour, he was shy; his international fame waned. Recent years have seen a revival of interest with price increases for his early art. London alone is host to three exhibitions this month including at the Tate.\n\nTate Britain calls Davie \"one of the first British artists after the war to develop an expressive form of abstraction\" producing \"kaleidoscopic canvases that the artist relates to his love of jazz\".","title":"Scottish artist Alan Davie dies at age 93"},{"doc_id":598,"text":"Herb Gray, a Canadian former deputy Prime Minister whose federal political career stretched 39 years, died yesterday.

The results were published on Tuesday in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThe agency's XMM-Newton Observatory, which is in space, detected X-rays emitted from the black holes pulling a star to shreds. Called 'tidal disruption events', items being consumed by black holes and giving off X-rays as they do are the primary method of spotting black holes.\n\nThis is problematic because only younger galaxies where stars are still forming are regular hosts to such events, with most galaxies believed to have a supermassive black hole at the centre. Mature systems, known as quiescent galaxies, only see items enter black holes from time to time and scientists have to be looking in the right place at the right time to find them.\n\nThe discovery dates to June 2010 when Dr Fukun Liu from China's Peking University noticed an apparent tidal disruption coming from a galaxy known as J120136. XMM-Newton was tasked to investigate, as was NASA's Swift satellite. The resultant data indicates a pair of black holes orbiting one another.\n\n\"There might be a whole population of quiescent galaxies that host binary black holes in their centers,\" said co-discoverer Stefanie Komossa of Germany's Max Planck Society.
